# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the React application as requested. The integration enables real-time performance tracking for the web app when deployed to Vercel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1` package to the project
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` accordingly

### 2. Modified Files
- **Frontend/src/App.jsx**
  - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';`
  - Wrapped the Routes component in a React Fragment (`<>...</>`)
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component after the Routes block
  - This ensures Speed Insights tracks all page navigations in the React Router application

### 3. Implementation Details
- Used `@vercel/speed-insights/react` which is the recommended package for React applications (Vite + React)
- Placed the SpeedInsights component at the root level of the App component to track all routes
- Followed the pattern from Vercel's documentation for create-react-app/Vite React applications
- The component will automatically inject the tracking script and start collecting performance metrics once deployed to Vercel

## Verification
✅ Build completed successfully without errors
✅ No linting errors introduced by the changes
✅ All dependencies installed correctly
✅ Package lock file updated

## Next Steps
To complete the setup:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab → Enable)
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. After deployment, verify the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script is loaded in the browser
4. View performance data in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab

## Notes
- The Speed Insights component only tracks metrics in production environments
- No additional configuration is required for basic usage
- The implementation follows Vercel's best practices for React/Vite applications
